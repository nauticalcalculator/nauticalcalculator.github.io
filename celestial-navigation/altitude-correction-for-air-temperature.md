## Altitude Correction for Air Temperature
This calculation provides a correction to be applied to the altitude of a celestial body when the air temperature varies from the 50Â° F used for determining mean refraction with the _Nautical Almanac_. For maximum accuracy, apply index correction and dip to sextant altitude first, obtaining apparent (rectified) altitude.
