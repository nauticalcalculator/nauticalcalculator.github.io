## Latitude and Longitude Factors
The latitude obtained by an ex-meridian sight is inaccurate if the longitude used in determining the meridian angle is incorrect. Similarly, the longitude obtained by solution of a time sight is inaccurate if the latitude used in the solution is incorrect, unless the celestial body is on the prime vertical.

This calculation gives the errors resulting from unit errors in the assumed values used in the computations.
