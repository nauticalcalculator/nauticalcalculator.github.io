## Distance of the Horizon
This calculation gives the distance in nautical and statute miles of the visible sea horizon for various heights of the eye in feet and meters. The actual distance varies somewhat as refraction changes. However, the error is generally less than that introduced by nonstandard atmospheric conditions. Also, the formula used contains an approximation which introduces a small error at the greatest heights tabulated.
