description:  Given the height of the light above sea level and the height of the eye of the observer above sea level, computes the geographic range.

## Geographic Range
This calculation gives the geographic range or the maximum distance at which the curvature of the earth permits light to be seen from a particular height of eye without regard to the luminous intensity of the light.

The geographic range depends upon the height of both the light and the eye of the observer.
