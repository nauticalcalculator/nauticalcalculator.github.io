# Correction of Barometer Reading for Height Above Sea Level
If simultaneous barometer readings at different heights are to be of maximum value in weather analysis, they should be converted to the corresponding readings at a standard height, usually sea level.

To convert the observed barometer reading to this level, enter the outside temperature and the height of the barometer above sea level. The height of a barometer is the height of its sensitive element; in the case of a mercurial barometer, this is the height of the free surface of the mercury in the cistern.

The correction calculated here applies to the readings of any type barometer and is always _added_ to the observed readings unless the barometer is below sea level.
